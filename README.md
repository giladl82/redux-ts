# My Simple Redux + TS project!

## Project goal

This project main goal is, for me to learn Redux while using Typescript with Ant Design.
It is the same project I've done with [Mobx](https://github.com/giladl82/mobx-ts) but with Redux as state manager

## Description and features

It is a small project with two simple stores

1. Tasks - remote data ([jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos))
2. Contacts - remote data ([jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users))

I've merged them into a single main store and combined it with the React Context API.

Both stores are represented by its own page with its own data view.
